## Problem 3: Healthcare for underserved communities


- The theme for this open innovation hackathon is using technology to improve access to healthcare for underserved communities.
- This theme is focused on addressing the disparities and challenges that many communities face in accessing quality healthcare services. 
- While healthcare is a basic human right, many people are unable to access it due to various factors such as financial barriers, geographic location, language barriers, and limited healthcare resources.



- The goal of this hackathon is to bring together software developers to develop innovative solutions that can help to overcome these barriers and improve access to healthcare for underserved communities.
- The theme is focused on leveraging technology to create solutions that can be easily scalable, affordable, and accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or circumstances. - The solutions developed through this hackathon can have a significant impact on improving healthcare outcomes and quality of life for underserved communities.



## Research around the Idea


- **Genetic disorders** are the result of mutation in the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) sequence which can be developed or inherited from parents.
- Such mutations may lead to fatal diseases such as **Alzheimerâ€™s, cancer, Hemochromatosis**, etc. Recently, the use of artificial intelligence-based methods has shown superb success in the prediction and prognosis of different diseases.
- The potential of such methods can be utilized **to predict genetic disorders at an early stage using the genome data for timely treatment**.
- This study focuses on the **multi-label multi-class problem** and makes two major contributions to genetic disorder prediction.
- A novel feature engineering approach is proposed where the class probabilities from an **extra tree (ET) and random forest (RF)** are joined to make a feature set for model training.
- Secondly, the study utilizes the **classifier chain approach** where multiple classifiers are joined in a chain and the predictions from all the preceding classifiers are used by the **conceding classifiers** to make the final prediction.
- Because of the **multi-label multi-class data, macro accuracy, Hamming loss, and Î±-evaluation score** are used to evaluate the performance. 
- Results suggest that extreme gradient boosting (XGB) produces the best scores with a **92% Î±-evaluation score and a 84% macro accuracy score**.
- The performance of **XGB** is much better than state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of both performance and **computational complexity**.

- **Logistic Regression --> 82.59 %**

- **RF --> 88.345 %**

- **XGBoost --> 75.45 %**



## Libraries Used

- ### Intel oneDAL

Building application using **intel oneDAL**: 
- The **Intel oneAPI Data Analytics Library (oneDAL)** contributes to the acceleration of big data analysis by providing **highly optimised algorithmic building blocks** for all phases of data analytics (preprocessing, transformation, analysis, modelling, validation, and decision making) in batch, online, and distributed processing modes of computation.
- The library optimizes **data ingestion** along with **algorithmic computation** to increase throughput and scalability.


#### Understanding of the data: 

- I learned how to **preprocess and clean** the data, as well as how to handle missing values and categorical variables. 
- I also have conducted exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the relationships between the **variables**.


#### Selection of appropriate algorithms: 

- Learned how to select appropriate machine learning algorithms for the given problem. 
- For example, **logistic regression** may be useful for **binary classification problems**, while **decision trees** may be better suited for multiclass problems.

#### Machine Learning:
- Learned about different machine learning algorithms and how they can be applied to predict **cardiovascular disease** and make recommendations for patients.

#### Data Analysis: 
- I developed my experience in collecting and analyzing large amounts of data, including historical data, to train our **machine learning** models.

#### Comparison of model performance:
-  I got experience with, how to compare the **performance** of different models using appropriate statistical tests or **visualizations**. 
- This can help you choose the best model for the given problem.

#### Collaboration:
- Building a project like this likely required collaboration with a team of experts in various fields, such as **medical science, machine learning, and data analysis**, and I learned the importance of working together to achieve common goals.
